> Tools for the Web

## Usage

Add it to your project:

```shell
cargo add web-tools
```

## Rationale

Rust has a strict type system, which is great. But sometimes it's just convenient to use:

```rust
use web_tools::prelude::*;

fn callback(node: &NodeRef) {
    node.focus();
}
```

## Functionality

* Optimistic traits: execute some function on an element, if it supports it â€¦ or do nothing.
* Iterators for things that should be iterable, but don't implement `IntpIterator`.
